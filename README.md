CDANs is a constraint-based causal discovery algorithm designed for time
series that are both **autocorrelated** (today depends on yesterday) and
**non-stationary** (the dependence pattern itself changes over time). It
addresses three limitations of previous methods:

1. **High dimensionality** — by using lagged parents as the conditioning set
   for contemporaneous CI tests, CDANs avoids conditioning on the full past.
2. **No lagged edges** — most CD-NOD-style methods only recover
   contemporaneous structure; CDANs recovers both lagged and contemporaneous.
3. **Order dependence** — the discovered skeleton does not depend on the
   order in which variables are listed in the input.

## Installation

```bash
pip install cdans
```

For development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hferdous/CDANs.git
cd CDANs
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Quickstart

```python
from cdans import CDANs
from cdans.utils import generate_synthetic_cdans

# 1. Generate a dataset with known ground truth.
dataset = generate_synthetic_cdans(
    n_vars=5, n_samples=500, tau_max=2, n_changing=2, seed=42,
)

# 2. Fit the model.
model = CDANs(tau_max=2, alpha=0.05, ci_test="fisherz")
result = model.fit(dataset.data)

# 3. Inspect the recovered graph.
print(result.summary())
print("Lagged edges:        ", result.graph.lagged_edges)
print("Contemp adjacency:\n", result.graph.contemp_adj)
print("Changing modules:    ", result.graph.changing_modules)
```

A runnable version is in [`examples/quickstart.py`](examples/quickstart.py).

## Plotting

Two graph visualizations are available via tigramite:

```python
from cdans import plot_process_graph, plot_time_series_graph

plot_process_graph(result.graph, save_path="process.png")        # aggregate
plot_time_series_graph(result.graph, save_path="time_series.png")  # time-unrolled
```

Requires the `viz` extra: `pip install "cdans[viz]"`. See
[`examples/plotting.py`](examples/plotting.py) for a complete worked example.

## Evaluation

When you have ground truth (e.g. from `generate_synthetic_cdans`), score
the recovered graph with standard structure-recovery metrics:

```python
from cdans import CDANs, evaluate_graph
from cdans.utils import generate_synthetic_cdans

dataset = generate_synthetic_cdans(n_vars=5, n_samples=400, tau_max=2, seed=42)
result = CDANs(tau_max=2, ci_test="kci").fit(dataset.data)

metrics = evaluate_graph(result.graph, dataset)
print(metrics.summary())
print(f"SHD: {metrics.shd_total},  lagged TPR: {metrics.lagged.tpr:.2f},  FDR: {metrics.lagged.fdr:.2f}")
```

Reported separately for lagged edges, contemp skeleton, contemp directed,
and changing modules: TP / FP / FN / precision / recall (= TPR) / FDR / F1,
plus SHD per category and total.

## API

The library is built around two layers:

### High-level: `CDANs` class

```python
CDANs(
    tau_max=2,                # max lag
    alpha=0.05,               # CI test significance level
    pc_alpha=0.2,             # looser alpha for PC step inside Step 1
    ci_test="fisherz",        # or "kci", or your own CITest instance
    surrogate="time",         # or pass an array of shape (n_samples,)
    max_extra_conds=2,        # contemp neighbors added to lagged conds
    use_independent_change=True,
    independent_change_width="auto",  # or a positive float
    verbose=False,
)
```

`fit(data)` returns a `CDANsResult` with:

* `.graph` — `TimeSeriesGraph` (lagged edges, contemporaneous adjacency,
  changing modules)
* `.timings` — wall-clock per step
* `.config` — the configuration used
* `.summary()` — pretty-printed report

### Low-level: `cdans.steps` submodule

The four steps can be invoked individually, which is useful for research
and for swapping in your own implementations:

```python
from cdans.steps import (
    discover_lagged_adjacencies,   # Step 1
    build_partial_graph,           # Step 2
    refine_skeleton,               # Step 3
    orient_edges,                  # Step 4
)
```

Each step takes a `TimeSeriesGraph` (or produces one for Step 1) and mutates
it in place.

## Algorithm overview

CDANs has four steps, each mapped to a section of the paper:

| Step | Paper §  | Module                                    | What it does                                                                       |
| ---- | -------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | §3.1     | `cdans.steps.step1_lagged`                | MCI tests find lagged adjacencies `X_i[t-lag] -> X_j[t]`                           |
| 2    | §3.2     | `cdans.steps.step2_partial_graph`         | Build the partial graph: lagged + fully-connected contemporaneous + surrogate `C`  |
| 3    | §3.3     | `cdans.steps.step3_skeleton`              | **The key step.** Prune contemporaneous edges using lagged-parent conditioning sets, and confirm changing modules |
| 4    | §3.4     | `cdans.steps.step4_orient`                | Orient contemp edges via v-structures + Meek's rules                               |

The graph is encoded as a `TimeSeriesGraph` (see `cdans.graph`).
Independence tests live in `cdans.ci_tests` and are pluggable.

## Acknowledgements

CDANs builds on prior work in constraint-based causal discovery, notably:

* **CD-NOD** (Huang & Zhang, 2017) — provides the surrogate-variable
  construction and the changing-module formalism. The Python implementation
  in [`causal-learn`](https://github.com/py-why/causal-learn) was used as
  a reference when porting the KCI test that ships with this library.
* **PCMCI** (Runge et al., 2019) — provides the MCI conditional
  independence framework that Step 1 implements. The original reference
  implementation is in [`tigramite`](https://github.com/jakobrunge/tigramite);
  CDANs ships an independent self-contained Python port.
* **KCI** (Zhang, Peters, Janzing & Schölkopf, 2011) — kernel-based
  conditional independence test. CDANs includes an in-house implementation
  in `cdans.ci_tests.kci`, validated to produce identical p-values to
  the `causal-learn` reference on a battery of synthetic test cases.
* **Meek's rules** (Meek, 1995) — used in Step 4 for orientation propagation.

## Documentation

A full documentation site is included. To build and serve it locally:
